Streamline the application process using WorkSort -- a job posting organizer. WorkSort is a web app designed for bookmarking and organizing job postings.
## How to Use

* Click the `New Job` button to start entering information about a job offer you'd like to bookmark. In the input fields, enter the **Title**, **Company**, **Date**, and **URL** associated with the offer. You may also add some **Notes** about the offer, as well as specify the **Table** to insert the job into. When you're done, click `Add Job` to append the offer to the specified list of job offers.
* Click a job's `View` button to view, edit or delete the information associated with that particular job listing.
* Click `New Table` to create and name a new table.
* Use `<` and `>` to navigate between different tables.
* Rename or delete the selected job table with the `Edit` and `Delete` buttons to the right of the table name.
  * *Note:* A table must be empty before it can be deleted. The `Main` table cannot be renamed or deleted. Two tables may not share the same name.
